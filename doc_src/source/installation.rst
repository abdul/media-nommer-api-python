Installation
============

Due to the early state of this project, there is a good chance that parts of
these instructions are out of date at any given time. If you run into any such
issue please let us know on our `issue tracker`_.

Requirements
------------

* Python_ 2.6 or 2.7. Python_ 3.x is not supported (yet).

Installing
----------

The easiest way is to install the package is through :command:`pip` or
:command:`easy_install`::

    pip install media-nommer-api
    
.. note::
    This will only work once we start distributing media-nommer-api on PyPi. 
    For now, you'll need to download a tarball/zip, or check the source out from
    our `GitHub project`_ and install via the enclosed ``setup.py``. See the
    ``requirements.txt`` within the project for dependencies.
